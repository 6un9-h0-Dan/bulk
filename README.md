## Dependencies

Bulk has been tested with Python 2.7.
Bulk REQUIRES Python 2.7+ due to its use of argparse. Easy
installation of bulk requires setuptools.
There is no desire at this time to add compatibility for
older versions of Python.

## Build & Install

After installing the dependencies, install bulk by:

```
tar xzvf bulk-<version>.tar.gz
cd bulk-version
python setup.py build
sudo python setup.py install
```

Bulk scripts, such as bulk_proxy.py, can be placed in non-default locations
by using `--install-scripts /path/you/want` when calling `python setup.py install`.
This is useful if you managing multiple versions of python on a machine.

You can test your installation by invoking Python and trying to import bulk.

# Basic Usage

Bulk is essentially an SMTP proxy, so you can run it as a listening service.
Otherwise, you can daemonize it in your OS's fashion. Bulk comes with scripts
to be run as services.

To run it as a service (with default options):

`bulk_proxy.py`

Or to check the help

```
bulk_proxy.py --help

usage: bulk_proxy.py [-h] [--bind_address BIND_ADDRESS]
                     [--bind_port BIND_PORT] [--remote_address REMOTE_ADDRESS]
                     [--remote_port REMOTE_PORT]
                     [--base_log_directory BASE_LOG_DIRECTORY]
                     [--log_all_messages] [--block] [--always_block]
                     [--save_attachments] [--log_config LOG_CONFIG]

# Logging

Logging is accomplished via [Python's logging module](http://docs.python.org/library/logging.html).

To configure logging for bulk, use a configuration file. You can
see the default configuration file in `conf/logging.conf`. You can
pass a logging.conf file using the `--logging` command line option.
